# Connotation frames of Agency and Power
Last updated: July 9th, 2017

### File Description
The *power* and *agency* connotation frames contained in `agency_power.csv` are formatted as follows.
Each row after the header contains the verb (conjugated in its 3rd person singular form),
the agency label (pos, neg, equal) and the power label (agent, theme, equal).

For verbs with either no agency or no power label, the corresponding csv cell will be empty.
### Annotation process
All verbs were rated by 3 AMT crowdworkers, using placeholders to avoid contextual bias. E.g. "X alters Y".

See the paper (below) for more information.
